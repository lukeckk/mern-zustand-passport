BENEFITS OF ZUSTAND LOGIN FLOW:
1. User state is centralized in the Zustand store, not scattered across components
2. Login logic is abstracted into the store, making Login component simpler
3. User state persists via localStorage even when page refreshes
4. Any component can access current user state without props drilling
5. Loading states are managed consistently in the store
6. JWT remains securely stored only in HTTP-only cookie
