SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS FOR DELETE FUNCTIONALITY
----------------------------------------------

1. FRONTEND SECURITY:
   - Delete button only rendered if (user && user.isAdmin) is true
   - Even if button is artificially added to DOM, API requests require auth cookie

2. API SECURITY:
   - JWT in HTTP-only cookie (not accessible via JavaScript)
   - DELETE request requires 'credentials: include' to send cookie

3. BACKEND SECURITY:
   - authenticate middleware verifies valid JWT token
   - isAdmin middleware ensures user has admin privileges
   - Both middleware must pass before delete operation executes

4. DATABASE SECURITY:
   - Product deletion performed using Mongoose's findByIdAndDelete
   - Operation is atomic and transactional
   - Only the specific requested product ID is affected
